Package dumper implements a deep pretty printer for Go data structures to aid
data snapshotting.

A quick overview of the additional features dumper provides over the built-in
printing facilities for Go data types are as follows:

  - Pointers are dereferenced and followed
  - Circular data structures are detected and annotated
  - Byte arrays and slices are dumped in a way similar to the hexdump -C command
    which includes byte values in hex, and ASCII output

The approach dumper allows for dumping Go data structures is less flexible than
its parent tool. It has just a:

  - Dump style which prints with newlines and customizable indentation

# Quick Start

This section demonstrates how to quickly get started with dumper. See the
sections below for further details on formatting and configuration options.

To dump a variable with full newlines, indentation, type, and pointer
information use Dump, Fdump, or Sdump:

	dumper.Dump(myVar1)
	dumper.Fdump(someWriter, myVar1)
	str := dumper.Sdump(myVar1)

# Configuration Options

Configuration of dumper is handled by fields in the ConfigState type.  For
convenience, all of the top-level functions use a global state available
via the dumper.Config global.

It is also possible to create a ConfigState instance that provides methods
equivalent to the top-level functions.  This allows concurrent configuration
options.  See the ConfigState documentation for more details.

The following configuration options are available:

  - Indent
    String to use for each indentation level for Dump functions.
    It is a single space by default. A popular alternative is "\t".

  - NumericWidth
    NumericWidth specifies the number of columns to use when dumping
    a numeric slice or array (including bool). Zero specifies all entries
    on one line.

  - StringWidth
    StringWidth specifies the number of columns to use when dumping
    a string slice or array. Zero specifies all entries on one line.

  - BytesWidth
    Number of byte columns to use when dumping byte slices and arrays.

  - CommentBytes
    Specifies whether ASCII comment annotations are attached to byte
    slice and array dumps.

  - CommentPointers
    CommentPointers specifies whether pointer information will be added
    as comments.

  - IgnoreUnexported
    Specifies that unexported fields should be ignored.

  - ElideType
    ElideType specifies that type information defined by context should
    not be printed in a dump.

  - SortKeys
    Specifies map keys should be sorted before being printed. Use
    this to have a more deterministic, diffable output.  Note that
    only native types (bool, int, uint, floats, uintptr and string)
    are supported with other types sorted according to the
    reflect.Value.String() output which guarantees display stability.
    Natural map order is used by default.

# Dump Usage

Simply call dumper.Dump with a list of variables you want to dump:

	dumper.Dump(myVar1)

You may also call dumper.Fdump if you would prefer to output to an arbitrary
io.Writer.  For example, to dump to standard error:

	dumper.Fdump(os.Stderr, myVar1)

A third option is to call dumper.Sdump to get the formatted output as a string:

	str := dumper.Sdump(myVar1)

# Sample Dump Output

See the Dump example for details on the setup of the types and variables being
shown here.

	main.Foo{
	 unexportedField: &main.Bar{
	  flag: main.Flag(1),
	  data: uintptr(0),
	 },
	 ExportedField: map[interface{}]interface{}{
	  string("one"): bool(true),
	 },
	}

Byte (and uint8) arrays and slices are displayed uniquely, similar to the hexdump -C
command as shown.

	[]uint8{
	 0x11, 0x12, 0x13, 0x14, 0x15, 0x16, 0x17, 0x18, // |........|
	 0x19, 0x1a, 0x1b, 0x1c, 0x1d, 0x1e, 0x1f, 0x20, // |....... |
	 0x21, 0x22, 0x23, 0x24, 0x25, 0x26, 0x27, 0x28, // |!"#$%&'(|
	 0x29, 0x2a, 0x2b, 0x2c, 0x2d, 0x2e, 0x2f, 0x30, // |)*+,-./0|
	 0x31, 0x32,                                     // |12|
	}
